# ü¶Å Columbia Radiology Lab UV Spectroscopy Research Project (Fall 2024)

- Technologies: SwiftUI, Python, OpenCV
- Contributors: David Welch, Ali Zia, Columbia Radiology Lab

## About
With the help of NASA funding and support  of the Columbia Radiology Lab, this project is an effort to help researchers capture images of excited phosphors emitting a desired wavelength.



### Week 1/2
- Completed the setup of the app in SwiftUI
- Researched the purpose behind UV imaging and the physics of how it works

### Week 3/4
- Completed tab bar setup and basic image processing based on hue value
- Researching the data science aspect of how to process images and place them in the hue range of the desired phosphour

### Week 5/6/7
- Completed a matrix UI for viewing condensed results of hue matrix after taking a photo
- Currently working on improving hue accuracy values
